#sarna-bio-readme

Hello, My name is Sarna, im a rising junior at Townsend Harris High School in Queens, New York. I love STEM, dance, and socializing. Fun Fact: I've been dancing for 13 years! 
I also hope to become a computer or mechanical engineer and an expert in STEM. I am a beginner at coding but eager to learn! I can't wait to see what projects I will create with you all!
